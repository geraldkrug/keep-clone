was generated using fdroid termux phone apk
A download of a zipped .apk is generated for user
to install. On Android phone apk opens and stops and that is all I want it to do. Main use case is I 
change the home screen icon then generate 
a new apk for many different reasons. 

Use package installer 
If an APK explorer app is installed on your phone
it will stop the choice to use the Android package installer. Uninstall apk explorer apps.

To stop Google from scanning unknown APKs, you need to disable Google Play Protect's scanning features within the Play Store settings and potentially adjust app permissions for unknown sources.

If you lose your phone before it gets locked
this app shows my phone number on an icon anywhere 
you place it on the phone home screen.

Once you place the icon on your home screen take a screenshot. Send me the screenshot so I can identify the 
phone and return to you.
