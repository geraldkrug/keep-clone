This makes a debug .apk to install on Android phones.
All the work was done with an older model smartphone.
No desktop computer needed.
Actions > Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions
has the manually inputted 
.p12 and passwords and alias for apk signing.
A download of a zipped .apk is generated
to install. On Android phone apk opens and stops and that is all I want it to do. Main use case is I 
change the home screen icon then generate 
a new apk for many different reasons.
