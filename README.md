This makes a debug .apk to install on Android phones.
All the work was done with an older model smartphone.
No desktop computer needed.
Action > Settings > Secrets has the 
.p12 and passwords and alias for signing.
A download of a zipped .apk os generated
to install. It opens and stops and that os all 
I want it to do. Main use case is I 
change the home screen icon then generate 
a new apk for many different reasons.
